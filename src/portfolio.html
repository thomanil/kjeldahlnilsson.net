<h1>Current projects</h1>

<p>I'm currently working at <a href="http://gitorious.com">Gitorious
AS</a>, a Norwegian startup in the Git hosting space. For me, this is
an ideal mix of entrepreneurship and software development.</p>

<p>In addition I sometimes teach Ruby workshops
through <a href="http://rubykurs.no">Rubykurs.no</a> (where I'm one of
the cofounders).</p>

<p>You can find my code
  on <a href="http://github.com/thomanil">Github</a>.</p>

<h1>Past projects</h1>

<h2><a href="http://mineverktoy.no">Mine Verktøy</a> (2011)</h2>

The Norwegian version of "The
  Setup". For about a year during 2011 I published weekly interviews
  with norwegian techies and creatives about which software and
  hardware tools they use. Currently dormant, but a new editor will
  soon take over.
  
<h2><a href="http://thoughtmuse.com">ThoughtMuse</a> (2009)</h2>

Created an online
  mindmapping product, implemented as browser-based SaaS service in
  JavaScript and Rails. Bootstrapped it from idea to launched product
  in 6 months. Didn't make a lot of money but learnt a lot about
  product development and entrepreneurship.
  
<h2><a href="http://messynotebook.com/?p=71">QuickTetris</a> (2009)</h2>

I wrote a web-based Tetris
  clone in order to improve my grasp of frontend development. I also
  documented the experience in a series of blog
  posts: <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/writing-a-javascript-tetris-lessons-learned-from-a-ruby-chap">"Writing
  a JavaScript Tetris; Lessons learned from a Ruby chap"</a>. The
  article was featured on ajaxian.com during the winter of
  2009.
