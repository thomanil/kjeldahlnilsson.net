	made a potentially risky development process smooth and
	rapid.”<em>&mdash; Jo Ring Giske, Enterprise Architect at Mattilsynet</em> </blockquote> </p>

<p>I'm available for both small and large projects, on-site
in the Oslo region in Norway, or remotely anywhere (with occasional on-site
	visits). <em>I currently have available time starting January 2016.</em> </p>

    track, and both clients and colleagues have appreciated his focus on
    options and tradeoffs when prioritizing.”

	kind and honest. I give Thomas my very best
	recommendations, even though I would like to keep him
