<h1>Need professional software development?</h1>

<p>Everyone needs a bit of extra help with their projects occasionally.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Too much to do right now? Need an extra set of hands on your team?</li>
	<li>Hiring and training in new areas takes time. Does your team lack a certain skillset today?</li>
	<li>Struggling with your software development project? Need some independent, objective advice?</li>
	<li>Do you need a quick prototype built ASAP, with as little fuss as possible?</li>
</ul>

<h2>I can help you</h2>

<p>
	I'm an independent software developer and consultant with over
	fifteen years experience. Clients consistently refer to me as <strong>competent,
	versatile, reliable and extremely easy to work with.</strong>
</p>

<p> <blockquote> “...delivered more than we expected in less time than
	estimated&hellip; his sound methods and great people skills
	made a potentially risky development process smooth and
	rapid.”<em>&mdash; Jo Ring Giske, Enterprise Architect at Mattilsynet</em> </blockquote> </p>

<p>Expert fields:</p>

<strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Web development</li>
		<li>Android development</li>
		<li>System architecture</li>
		<li>Java, JavaScript and Ruby programming</li>
	</ul>
</strong>

<p>Broad, solid experience in:</p>

<strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Backend/server development</li>
		<li>Devops</li>
		<li>Mentoring and teaching</li>
	</ul>
</strong>

<p>Finally, I also have basic skills in <strong>UI/UX design work,
	marketing, product development and project management.</strong> While I
	can do basic work in these fields myself, what you <em>really</em> want
	is to have me, as a software developer, collaborate with specialists
	in any of these disciplines: then we'll both truly shine.

<h2>Selected projects</h2>

<h3>NSB Underholdning</h3>

<p>A high-profile app that the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) provides
to its customers. For users with recent train tickets, the app
provides free audio books, podcasts, music and more. As part of the
Shortcut team building this, I ironed out the system architecture of
the project and developed the initial Android version of the
app. Though faced with a challenging deadline, the project shipped
on-time, and is used daily by thousands of commuters.
</p>

<h3>NAF Bilen Min</h3>

<p>This app is part of a major effort on part of the Norwegian
Automobile Federation (NAF) to create new, rich digital services for
their customers. As part of the Shortcut team building this, I worked
on system architecture, some Android development, web frontend,
backend/integration development, and mentoring of junior project
members. The project shipped on time, on budget and had multiple tens
of thousands of users as of Q3 2015.

<blockquote>“[Thomas] is smart, very dedicated, structured
	and quality conscious. I have been blessed to have him
	on several of my projects, where he always helped me
	stay one step ahead and predict future
	risks. [&hellip;] He possesses excellent
	communications skills and is very patient and pleasant
	to work with. On top of that he is very considerate,
	kind and honest. I give Thomas my very best
	recommendations, even though I would like to keep him
	to myself.”<em> &mdash; Ina Tegnander, project manager at Shortcut AS</em>
