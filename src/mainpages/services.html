<h1>Need professional software development?</h1>

<p>Everyone needs a bit of extra help with their projects occasionally.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Too much to do right now? Need an extra set of hands on your team?</li>
	<li>Hiring and training in new areas takes time. Does your team lack a certain skillset today?</li>
	<li>Do you need a quick prototype built ASAP, with as little fuss as possible?</li>
</ul>

<h2>I'm here to help</h2>

<p>
	I'm an independent software developer with over fifteen years
	experience. Clients consistently refer to me as <strong>competent,
	versatile, reliable and extremely easy to work with.</strong>
</p>

<p> <blockquote> “...delivered more than we expected in less time than
	estimated&hellip; his sound methods and great people skills
	made a potentially risky development process smooth and
	rapid.”<em>&mdash; Jo Ring Giske, Enterprise Architect at Mattilsynet</em> </blockquote> </p>

<p>I'm available for both small and large projects, on-site in Oslo,
	or remotely anywhere (with occasional on-site visits). <em>I currently
	have available time starting January 2016.</em> </p>

<blockquote>“Thomas is a man of many talents, and a pleasure to work
	with. His practical professionalism has helped get difficult
	projects back on track, and both clients and colleagues have
	appreciated his focus on options and tradeoffs when prioritizing.”<em>&mdash; Marius Mårnes Mathisen, Chief Strategy Officer at Shortcut AS</em> </blockquote>

<p>Expert fields:</p>

<strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Web development</li>
		<li>Android development</li>
		<li>System architecture</li>
		<li>Java, JavaScript and Ruby programming</li>
	</ul>
</strong>

<p>I also have broad, solid experience in:</p>

<strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Backend/server development</li>
		<li>Devops</li>
		<li>Mentoring and teaching</li>
	</ul>
</strong>

<p>Finally, I also have basic skills in <strong>UI/UX design work,
	marketing, and project management.</strong> While I
	can do basic work in these fields myself, what you <em>really</em> want
	is to have me, as a software developer, collaborate with specialists
	in any of these disciplines: then we'll both truly shine.
</p>


<blockquote>“[Thomas] is smart, very dedicated, structured
	and quality conscious. I have been blessed to have him
	on several of my projects, where he always helped me
	stay one step ahead and predict future
	risks. [&hellip;] He possesses excellent
	communications skills and is very patient and pleasant
	to work with. On top of that he is very considerate,
	kind and honest. I give Thomas my very best
	recommendations, even though I would like to keep him
	to myself.”<em> &mdash; Ina Tegnander, project manager at Shortcut AS</em>
