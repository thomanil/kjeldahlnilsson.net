<h1>Need professional software development?</h1>

<p>Everyone needs a bit of extra help with their projects occasionally.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Too much to do right now? Need an extra set of hands on your team?</li>
	<li>Hiring and training in new areas takes time. Does your team lack a certain skillset today?</li>
	<li>Struggling with your software development project? Need some independent, objective advice?</li>
	<li>Do you need a quick prototype built ASAP, with as little fuss as possible?</li>
</ul>

<h2>I can help you</h2>

<p>
	I'm an independent software developer and consultant with over
	fifteen years experience. Clients consistently refer to me as <strong>competent,
	versatile, reliable</strong> and <strong>extremely easy to work with.</strong>
</p>

<p> <blockquote> “...delivered more than we expected in less time than
	estimated&hellip; his sound methods and great people skills
	made a potentially risky development process smooth and
	rapid.”<em>&mdash; Jo Ring Giske, Enterprise Architect at Mattilsynet</em> </blockquote> </p>

<p>Expert fields:</p>

<strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Android development</li>
		<li>Web development</li>
		<li>System architecture</li>
		<li>Java, JavaScript and Ruby programming</li>
	</ul>
</strong>

<p>Broad, solid experience in:</p>

<strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Backend/server development</li>
		<li>Devops</li>
		<li>Mentoring and teaching</li>
	</ul>
</strong>

<p>Finally, I also have basic skills in <strong>project management, UI/UX design work,
	marketing and product development.</strong> While I
	can do basic work in these fields myself, what you <em>really</em> want
	is to have me, as a software developer, collaborate with specialists
	in any of these disciplines: then we'll both truly shine.

<h2>Selected projects</h2>

<h3>NSB Underholdning</h3>

<p>A high-profile app that the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) provides
to its customers. For users with recent train tickets, the app
	provides free audio books, podcasts, music and more.</p>

<p>As part of the Shortcut team building this, I ironed out the system
architecture of the project and developed the initial Android version
	of the app.</p>

<p>Though faced with a challenging deadline, the project shipped on-time,
and is used daily by thousands of commuters.
</p>

<blockquote>“[Thomas] is smart, very dedicated, structured
	and quality conscious. I have been blessed to have him
	on several of my projects, where he always helped me
	stay one step ahead and predict future
	risks. [&hellip;] He possesses excellent
	communications skills and is very patient and pleasant
	to work with. On top of that he is very considerate,
	kind and honest. I give Thomas my very best
	recommendations, even though I would like to keep him
	to myself.”<em> &mdash; Ina Tegnander, Project Manager at Shortcut AS</em>
</blockquote>




<h3>NAF Bilen Min</h3>

<p>This app is part of a major effort on part of the Norwegian
Automobile Federation (NAF) to create new, rich digital services for
	their customers.</p>

<p>As part of the Shortcut team building this, I worked on system
architecture, some Android development, web frontend,
backend/integration development, and mentoring of junior project
	members.</p>

<p>The project shipped on time, on budget and had multiple tens of
thousands of users as of Q3 2015.
</p>


<blockquote>“Thomas was a great asset to the team with his calm, friendly and
professional manner combined with his broad knowledge and
expertise. One of the things I liked best about working with Thomas
was his pedagogical ways of explaining complex technical problems. I
could always count on Thomas getting the job done and I warmly
recommend him.”<em> &mdash; Jonas Dalsenius, Project Manager at the Norwegian Automobile Federation (NAF)</em>
