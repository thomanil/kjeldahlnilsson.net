<p>I'm a software developer &mdash; I do things and make things.</p>

<p>I've earned my living in software since 1999, and I'm currently
 keeping busy contributing to
 the <a href="http://gitorious.org/gitorious">Gitorious project</a>,
 as well as building a viable business
 at <a href="http://www.gitorious.com">Gitorious AS</a>.</p>

<p>My current interests include entrepreneurship, design, Unix, high
   level programming languages and pragmatic development methods.</p>

<p>My free time is spent on my wife and two daughters,
   <a href="/portfolio.php">programming</a>, drawing, and 
   <a href="http://www.sentrumaikido.org">Aikido</a>.
