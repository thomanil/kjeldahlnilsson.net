<p>I'm a software developer &mdash; I do things and make things.</p>

<p>I've earned my living in software since 1999, and I'm currently
busy with <a href="http://www.gitorious.com">Gitorious</a>.</p>

<p> My current interests include entrepreneurship, design, Unix, high
  level programming languages and pragmatic development
  methods.</p>

<p>My free time is spent on my wife and two daughters,
  <a href="/portfolio.php">programming</a>, drawing, 
  some <a href="http://www.sentrumaikido.org">Aikido</a> and the
  occasional video game.
