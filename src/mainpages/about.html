<p>I'm a software developer &mdash; I do things and make things.</p>

<p>I've earned my living in software since 1999. I'm currently working
on Android (and mobile web) development at <a href="http://www.shortcut.no">Shortcut AS.</a>
</p>


<p>My current interests include entrepreneurship, design, Unix, high
   level programming languages and pragmatic development methods.</p>

<p>My free time is spent on my wife and two daughters, beer brewing
and <a href="http://www.sentrumaikido.org">Aikido</a>.
