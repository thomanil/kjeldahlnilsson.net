<p>I'm a software developer &mdash; I've earned my living in software since 1999.</p>

<p>My current interests include entrepreneurship, design, Unix, high
   level programming languages and pragmatic development methods.</p>

<p>My free time is spent on my wife and two daughters. I dabble in beer brewing, martial arts and drawing.
