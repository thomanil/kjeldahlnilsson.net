<p>I should be doing a little <a title="The Little Schemer" href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1214139815&amp;sr=8-1">functional programming</a> in my spare time, but summer holiday has arrived and I'm entitled to relax. So now for something completely different.</p>

<p>I'm nurturing a growing interest in user interaction design and graphical user interfaces. This is largely due to my current workplace; at <a title="Favorite Systems website" href="http://www.favouritesystems.com" target="_blank">Favourite Systems</a> we create a cool new user interface for mobile phones. So, our in-house technology is very visually oriented, and some of my past and present colleagues are quite talented in visual design.</p>

<p>I, however, am not. To put it this way: when I see an awful user interface like, say, your average Linux application GUI, I think: <em>"That looks like something I could've created myself."</em> No, that's not a complement.</p>

<p>I also like many of <a title="iPod Touch" href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">Apple's</a> <a title="MacBook" href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">products</a>, specifically for their focus on strong product design.</p>

<p>Inspired by all this, I've started thinking more actively about visual design and user interaction design over the last year (in addition to design as applied to software engineering, which I have more experience with). So I recently bought <a title="Universal Principles of Design book link" href="http://www.rockpub.com/description.asp?isbn=1-59253-007-9&amp;topicid=4">Universal Principles of Design</a> - mainly to do some light reading during the summer.</p>

<p><img src="http://thomas.kjeldahlnilsson.net/images/uploads/2008/06/univprincipofdesigncover.jpg" alt="UniversalPrinciplesOfDesignCover" align="center" /></p>

<p>I quite enjoyed this book. Reading it was a pleasantly different experience from the sometimes <a title="Regex blog post" href="http://thomas.kjeldahlnilsson.net/blog/?p=29">dry and/or dreary CS textbooks</a> I usually chew my way through.</p>

<p>The physical book itself is aesthetically very appealing. One principle is detailed per two page spread. The left page provides a textual summary, while the right page contains visual examples - sometimes strikingly interesting ones. The book is a case study in the principles it discusses; examples include <strong>Consistency </strong>(two pages for every principle), <strong>Golden Ratio </strong> (check out the cover depicted above), <strong>Legibility</strong> (every page has a nice clean feel), and <strong>Signal-To-Noise Ratio</strong> (very little of the material felt like "padding").</p>

<p>The book introduces the reader to exactly one hundred general design principles. They areÂ  discussed with examples drawn from a wide range of applications in architecture, graphical design and software GUIs.</p>

<p>Some principles seem applicable mainly to specific fields (<a title="Prospect-Refuge theory explained" href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1678949">Prospect-Refuge</a>, to pick one, appears specific to architecture). Others are more obviously general across several fields (<strong>Redundancy</strong>, <strong>Prototyping</strong> and <strong>Flexibility-Usability Tradeoff</strong> are examples of principles used in both <a title="Industrial Design definition" href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design">industrial design</a> and software engineering).</p>

<p>I'm <a title="Paul Graham essay" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">hardly the first</a><strong> </strong>to point out the overlap between design and craftsmanship in software engineering and other disciplines such as graphical arts. I do however find this interesting to think about, and this book helps you do exactly that.</p>

<p>Interestingly, though reading this book was prompted by thinking about software and user interface design, I now also find I want to attain at least a sliver of competency in graphical design. I actually really enjoyed drawing as a kid, both on paper and electronically. Unfortunately, I gave that up sometime before <a title="Wikipedia Deluxe Paint entry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint">Deluxe Paint</a> went out of fashion. I really should pick up that thread again sometime.</p>
