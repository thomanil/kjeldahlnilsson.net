<p>  <em>It's evening, and my home office door is closed. No email or IM clients are running on my computer. My daughter is asleep, my Significant Other is aware that I'm working. I wind up the egg timer, the clock starts ticking. My mind quickly enters a state of <a title="Wikipedia definition of 'Flow'" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a>. 25 minutes later the timer rings. The feeling is akin to waking up from a dream. I stop working, and jot down a mark in my task list. A solid unit of work accomplished; another egg completed.</em></p>

<p>I have trouble maintaining a consistent level of productivity - especially for side projects that I work on in my spare time. Both at work and privately I find that my productivity fluctuates wildy. Sometimes I'm able to crank out quality stuff for 10 hours straight, while other days simply vanish in trivial distractions.</p>

<p>A possible remedy to this problem presented itself recently in the <a title="Pomodoro Technique" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> ("Tomato Technique"), a time management method I'd never heard of before last week. I've currently only used this system for a few days, but the early results are quite promising.</p>

<p>Getting started is fairly simple:
<ol>
	<li>Set up some sort of timer. A <a title="mytomatoes.com online pomodoro tracker" href="http://mytomatoes.com/">software clock</a> works, but a physical clock is better.</li>
	<li><span>Select a task that you need to accomplish, and remove possible distractions.
</span></li>
	<li><span>Set the timer to 25 minutes.</span><span>
</span></li>
	<li><span>Work on the task until the timer rings.</span></li>
	<li><span>One "tomato" is now accomplished for the task - add a mark to the task record.
</span></li>
	<li><span>Take a short break before restarting the timer - 5 minutes or so.</span></li>
	<li><span> Take a longer break </span><span>once every four tomatoes.
</span></li>
</ol></p

<p>To me, the most obvious benefit of the technique is that it forces you to <a title="Wikipedia 'Timeboxing' entry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_boxing#Personal_Timeboxing">timebox</a> and <strong>really focus </strong>on your work. One resulting effect for me is that I get into the elusive "flow" state much earlier than before. There's more to it, though.</p>

<p>The regular breaks provide an opportunity to periodically step back and look at the current task from a different perspective: "Am I going about this in the wrong way? Maybe I'm even solving the wrong problem?" This is valuable - it's easy to lose sight of the larger picture when you're head down into the specifics of a task.</p>

<p>Over time your ability to estimate future tasks is likely to improve, since you have a more solid appreciation (and written record) of how much effort your past work took. Besides, it's generally a good idea to measure your work in abstract work units rather than directly in clock hours (the <a title="Poker Planning Game post at Coding Horror" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000981.html">Poker Planning Game</a> is another example of this phenomenon).</p>

<p>The final benefit of the system is the moral boost you get from continuously marking down those completed "tomatoes" (I personally refer to them as "eggs", since I use an egg-shaped timer). Think about it; don't you feel good when you complete a feature, article or bug fix? I find that this technique gives me that same satisfaction <strong>every 30 minutes</strong> - I may not finish that new feature tonight, but I know that every egg takes me closer to completion.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what this does for my productivity long-term. The next step in the technique is to actually start estimating future tasks in tomatoes instead of hours; I'll try that once I've gotten used to the basic workflow. I'll probably post an update in a few weeks.</p>
