<p>  For the past couple of months I've worked on a nontrivial project:<strong> build, launch and sell a commercial product on my own.</strong></p>

<p>I set fairly strict constraints for the project:
<ul>
	<li>Use less than five months to release the first version.</li>
	<li>Work on it no more than fifteen hours a week (nights and weekends).</li>
	<li>Don't neglect my family, which I love.</li>
	<li>Keep my dayjob, which I really enjoy.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Well, I did it. The result is <a title="ThoughtMuse link" href="http://thoughtmuse.com">ThoughtMuse</a>, an online mindmapping tool which runs in your browser. I released v.1.0 a week ago.</p>

<p>It's early days.Â  ThoughtMuse has some rough edges which I need to improve, and there's plenty of additional features I'd like to add to it.</p>

<p>So do I have any paying customers yet? Well, the magical first sale ticked in a few days after launch; the sweetest $35.40 I've ever earned. Building and selling something on your own is extremely rewarding. Making a profit? Sure, that would be nice as well. :)</p>

<p>You learn<strong> a lot</strong> by building a commercial product all on your own. I'm going to write more on this later on.</p>
